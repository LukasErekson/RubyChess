# RubyChess
A Ruby implementation of Chess to be played in the terminal.

This serves as a capstone project for [The Odin Project's Ruby Programming course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming). The whole repository is also an opportunity to practice the standards of a git repository and trying out a new workflow. Although this project is done on my own, I hope that the way I use git provides me with good practice at developing software in team-friendly way.
